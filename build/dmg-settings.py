# dmgbuild settings for mp3-to-m4b.
#
# Why dmgbuild (not create-dmg / scripted Finder): create-dmg drives Finder over
# Apple Events to lay out the window. In a headless build there is no Automation
# (TCC) grant, so the layout step silently no-ops → wrong window size, white gaps,
# generic icon positions (the fb2-to-epub neighbor learned this, .patches/001,003).
# dmgbuild writes the .DS_Store directly with ds_store/mac_alias, no Finder, so it
# works headless and the layout is baked in.
#
# Driven by make-dmg.sh via defines (-D): app=<path>, bg=<1x png>, icon=<icns>,
# appname=<NAME>. Background HiDPI: point at the 1x png; dmgbuild auto-discovers the
# sibling <name>@2x.png and compiles a multi-rep TIFF (tiffutil -cathidpicheck) so
# the background is crisp on Retina.
#
# Geometry is ported 1:1 from the fb2-to-epub neighbor (design-agreed, proven on
# macOS 26): window 920x440, background 960x440 (>= window, dark to every edge),
# app icon at (290,190), /Applications drop link at (630,190), icon size 120.
# Our SVG background slots are drawn at exactly these centers (see branding/
# dmg-background.svg), so icons land on their dashed slots.

# --- volume ----------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: the volume NAME is passed via the dmgbuild CLI (build_dmg volume_name),
# not from this settings file — make-dmg.sh sets it (and uses a unique name when
# testing, to dodge Finder remembering an old window size for the same volume name).

# --- window geometry (design-agreed, ported from fb2 neighbor) --------------
# macOS 26 opens the DMG window ~920x436 (visible content ~920x408) regardless of the
# remembered size. We size the window to 920x440 and draw the background art LARGER
# (960x440, dark to every edge) so a slightly-off window can never reveal white — only
# dark filler. Content is centered on the visible width (x=460).
# window_rect = ((x, y), (w, h)). x,y are screen position of the window origin.
window_rect = ((200, 120), (920, 440))

# Background art (1x; @2x sibling auto-picked up for Retina). The image may be LARGER
# than the window — that is intentional (see above). dmgbuild writes it as a
# top-left-anchored background (backgroundType=2 + backgroundImageAlias): no scaling,
# no centering. scroll_position=(0,0) below pins the content origin to top-left, so a
# wider Finder window reveals the dark filler to the right/below, never white.
